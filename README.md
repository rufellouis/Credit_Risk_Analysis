# Credit_Risk_Analysis

# Overview
To predict Credit Risk, using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, the dataset was oversampled using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersampled using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. Then, a combinatorial approach of over and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm was employed on the data. Next, a comparison was made between two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier.   All machine learning algoriths were evaluated using a confusion matrix, accuracy score, precision & recall scores, as well as f1 scores.  This repo emcompases the jupyter notesbooks that contain the python code to run the above analyses and this repo also contains the summary of the same, here in the README file.
